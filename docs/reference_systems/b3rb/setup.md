??? question "How do I know what branch Cerebri is on?"

	```bash title="Check cerebri branch."
	cd ~/cognipilot/ws/cerebri
	git status
	```
	Which should return:
	```bash
	On branch brave
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/brave'.

	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	```
	If it does not show that perform a `git checkout`:
	```bash title="Checkout brave branch on cerebri."
	git checkout brave
	```
