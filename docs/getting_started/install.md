# Installation for development computer

???+ tip "Looking for instructions on how to also install on a NavQPlus?"
    
    [Click here to get instructions on how to setup and configure a NavQPlus](../cranium/compute/navqplus/setup.md).
    Continue this guide for installing CogniPilot on a native development computer.

## Requirements

* [Ubuntu 24.04 host environment.](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* Stable internet connection for downloading and installing packages.

This may work on other environments but only Ubuntu 24.04 is officially supported.

## Optional before installing
### Setup SSH keys on host and GitHub

If planning to develop and make changes to code it is suggested to set up ssh keys, however, it is not strictly required to do so.

* Ensure that [ssh keys are setup](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) on host computer and GitHub to be able to clone the CogniPilot repositories with ssh.

### Setup GPG keys on host and GitHub

* Optionally [setup gpg keys](https://docs.github.com/articles/generating-a-gpg-key/) on host computer and GitHub to sign commits.

## Use CogniPilot universal installer
??? info "Using Docker instead."

    If preferring to use docker, there is a [Docker Development Container](advanced/docker.md) that may be used instead.

To install CogniPilot on a system download the universal installer and run it (**follow the prompts in the installer**).

```bash title="Download and run the universal installer:"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git wget -y
mkdir -p ~/cognipilot/installer
wget -O ~/cognipilot/installer/install_cognipilot.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CogniPilot/helmet/main/install/install_cognipilot.sh
chmod a+x ~/cognipilot/installer/install_cognipilot.sh
/bin/bash ~/cognipilot/installer/install_cognipilot.sh
```

???+ tip "When prompted to choose a release:"

    1. ***brave*** for the current stable non-development release.
    2. ***main*** for active development.

???+ tip "When prompted to choose installer type select **1** for **native**:"

    1. ***native*** select this for installing on development computer
    2. ***navqplus*** only if installing on a NavQPlus image that does not already have the installer on it.

???+ tip "When prompted to choose whether or not to use ssh-keys:"

    * ***y*** to [clone with ssh keys](#setup-ssh-keys-on-host-and-github), best for development work but only select if ssh keys are already present and setup with GitHub.
    * ***n*** to clone with https, best for users who do not plan to make modifications or develop.


## Build the workspace

???+ tip "The `build_workspace` script:"

     * Sets up the workspaces using vcs and yaml files provided in [helmet](../helmet/about.md).
     * Builds [Cranium](../cranium/about.md) ROS 2 workspace.
     * Builds [Cerebri](../cerebri/about.md) (Zephyr RTOS native_sim) for software-in-the-loop simulation.
     * Builds [Cyecca](../tools/cyecca/about.md) (control/estimation software).
     * Builds [Electrode](../electrode/about.md) ROS 2 workspace (ground station software).

Build the CogniPilot workspace with `build_workspace` script (**follow the prompts in the workspace builder**).

```bash title="Run the build_workspace script:"
build_workspace
```

???+ tip "When prompted to choose whether or not to use ssh-keys:"

    * ***y*** to [clone with ssh keys](#setup-ssh-keys-on-host-and-github), best for development work but only select if ssh keys are already present and setup with GitHub.
    * ***n*** to clone with https, best for users who do not plan to make modifications or develop.

???+ tip "When prompted to choose a platform to build:"

    1. ***b3rb*** is an ackermann based mobile robotic platform with simulation.
    2. ***melm*** is a differential drive based mobile robotic platform with simulation.
    3. ***rdd2*** is a quadcopter based mobile robotic platform with simulation.


## Platforms

Currently supported platforms in this release are B3RB and ELM4.

### Using a real platform:

* [**B3RB** hardware guide.](../reference_systems/b3rb/setup.md)
* **MELM** hardware guide coming soon.
* **RDD2** hardware guide coming soon.

### Simulating a platform:

* [**B3RB** simulation guide.](../reference_systems/b3rb/simulation.md)
* **MELM** simulation guide coming soon.
* **RDD2** simulation guide coming soon.

## Convenience Scripts
### docs script

???+ tip "The `docs` script:"

     * Downloads and builds the documentation repositories for the documentation currently being read so that contributions can be made easily.
     * Allows for selection of documents to be served with mkdocs.

To view the docs offline locally or to contribute to them use the `docs` convenience script (**follow the prompts for the correct docs**).

```bash title="Run the docs convenience script:"
docs
```

???+ tip "When prompted to choose whether or not to use ssh-keys:"

    * ***y*** to [clone with ssh keys](#setup-ssh-keys-on-host-and-github), best if contributing to the documentation but only select if ssh keys are already present and setup with GitHub.
    * ***n*** to clone with https, best for users who do not plan to contribute and only want a local viewer.

???+ tip "When prompted to choose a doc to build:"

    1. ***airy*** is the [airy developers guide site (airy.cognipilot.org)](https://airy.cognipilot.org).
    1. ***brave*** is the [brave developers guide site (brave.cognipilot.org)](https://brave.cognipilot.org).
    2. ***overview*** is the [release overview site (cognipilot.org)](https://cognipilot.org).

??? question "I ran the command where are the docs?"

### cyecca script

???+ tip "The `cyecca` script:"

     * Starts a JupyterLab instance for Cyecca to aid in developing control and estimation algorithms.

To [develop algorithms with `cyecca`](../tools/cyecca/about.md) use the `cyecca` convenience script.

```bash title="Run the cyeccs convenience script:"
cyecca
```
