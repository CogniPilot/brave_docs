# Corti Overview

Corti is the center for machine learning, path planning, dynamic mission adaptation, and other advanced tasks.

For the Brave release, Corti supports a bezier spline based trajectory generation for a rover. The generated trajectory and control inputs can be used to generate smooth paths for path planning.

Corti also has additional functionality based nodes such as one that transforms odometry messages into tf messages for ROS.
